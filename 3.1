//In this branch, I'd like to ask a question of the user and give them a prompt of possible answers.


//Original 3.0:

//Importing Foundation for RNG
import Foundation

// I'd like to do for i in weather, appropriate cars
var cars = ["good":"the Viper", "fair":"McLaren", "overcast":"Model S", "rainy":"GTR", "sunny":"Lambo", "clear":"'Vette", "foggy":"racing truck", "sandy":"Baja bug", "icy":"Model X", "apocalyptic":"dragon"] 

// Forcing NSDate flop into int; constraining to n, dict count
var RNG = Int(NSDate().timeIntervalSince1970)%(cars.count)  

// Weather fact basis
var weather = Array(cars.keys)[RNG] // Added .keys to print just key, not ("key","value")
var car = Array(cars.values)[RNG]

// Output
print("The weather is \(weather) today. May I recommend the \(car).")
